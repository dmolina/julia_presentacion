# Julia Talk

Material about a talk about Julia to Python programmers.

The talk was in Spanish, but the material are both in English and Spanish.

Slides done using (RISE plugin for jupyter)(https://github.com/damianavila/RISE
"RISE"), and the translation was done using the (great jupytext)[https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext].

The audience was mainly python programmers (in a Computer Science Faculty), so
Julia is compared against Python.
